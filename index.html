            <h3> Latest Project</h3>
            <p>My most recent project was a website that calculated the total cost of grocery items you wanted to purchase based off the current prices at different stores. This allows you to compare prices in one place for multiple combined items showing you the cheapest overall basket without wasting time walking between stores.</p>
